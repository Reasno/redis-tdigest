# redis-tdigest

This is a Redis module for the [t-digest](https://github.com/tdunning/t-digest/blob/master/docs/t-digest-paper/histo.pdf) data structure which can be used for accurate online accumulation of rank-based statistics such as quantiles and cumulative distribution at a point. The implementation is based on the [Merging Digest](https://github.com/tdunning/t-digest/blob/master/src/main/java/com/tdunning/math/stats/MergingDigest.java) implementation by the author.

## Building & Loading

Before going ahead, make sure that the Redis server you're using has support for [Redis modules](http://antirez.com/news/106).

First, you'll have to build the Redis t-digest module from source.

```
make
```

This should generate a shared library called `tdigest.so` in the root folder. You can now load it into Redis by using the following `redis.conf` configuration directive:

```
loadmodule /path/to/tdigest.so
```

Alternatively, you can load it on an ready running module by running the following commands:

```
MODULE LOAD /path/to/tdigest.so
```

## API

### `TDIGEST.NEW key compression`

Initializes a `key` to an empty t-digest structure with the `compression` provided.

*Reply:* `"OK"`

### `TDIGEST.ADD key value count [value count ...]`

Adds a `value` with the specified `count`. If key is is missing, an empty t-digest structure is initialized with a default compression of `400`. Returns the sum of counts for all values added.

*Reply:* `long long`

### `TDIGEST.CDF key value [value ...]`

Returns the cumulative distribution for all provided values. `value` must be a double. The cumulative distribution returned for all values is between `0..1`.

*Reply:* `double` array or `nil` if key missing

### `TDIGEST.QUANTILE key quantile [quantile ...]`

Returns the estimate values at all provided quantiles. `quantile` must be a `double` between `0..1`.

*Reply:* `double` array or `nil` if key missing

### `TDIGEST.DEBUG key`

Prints debug information about the t-digest.

*Reply:* bulk strings array
